     Before importing Halloween Unity-Chan, please import
     the original Unity-Chan package, available at
     http://unity-chan.com/download/datadownload.html

Launching The Scene:
  1. Make a new project in Unity.
  2. Drag this .unitypackage file into the Project window.
  3. After the .unitypackage is imported, open UnityChan_hw.unity,
     located in Assets/UnityChan/Scenes.
  4. Press the Play button.

Models/Prefabs:
  1. In Assets/UnityChan/Prefabs, there’s a prefab of Halloween 
     Unity-Chan with dynamics settings.
  2. In Assets/UnityChan/unitychan_hw, you can find the 
     corresponding .fbx file.
  3. If the materials in Assets/UnityChan/unitychan_hw/Materials
     stop working for some reason, look in the folder 
     Assets/UnityChan/unitychan_hw/UnityChanShader/Materials_hw
     using Explorer or Finder, and copy those files over the 
     broken ones. (This won’t work using the Project window itself.)

Notes for Unity Free users:
     This project makes use of post effects and other features 
     that require Unity Pro. 

     To see these effects, consider using a trial of Unity Pro.
