The License is established for such purposes.  
The License is established to declare that we will grant widely to users a license to use the Unity Characters and the digital asset data of Unity Characters for users’ secondary creative activities.  
By using the Unity Characters, any user who wishes to conduct secondary creative activities using the Unity Characters with or without compensation shall be deemed to have consented to and agreed to be bound by the License and these Guidelines without any reservation or adding other incidental conditions.
